# Hosting-Static-Website-Using-Terraform

In this project, I built a simple yet effective infrastructure for hosting a static website using **Terraform** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**.

My main objective was to demonstrate how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be applied to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of a static website hosting environment.
