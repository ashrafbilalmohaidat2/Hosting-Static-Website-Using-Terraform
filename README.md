# Hosting-Static-Website-Using-Terraform

In this project, we build a simple yet effective infrastructure for hosting a static website using **Terraform** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3**.  

The main objective is to showcase how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can be used to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of a static website hosting environment.
